# TwentyOneAppProject2

////Progress Report

Over the weekend I hit too many hick ups in planning and felt I wouldn't acheive what I wanted... yet! 
Still learning and good to acknowledge my limitations so I can work on crawling before walking.

////Planning

I quickly realised I wasn’t learning but rather starting to catastrophize over how to tweak the rules of the game to fit my own specs.

Issues were that I was avoiding adding basic game play (having a tie and an array where drawn cards go) and not looking to meet the mvp of having a suit and rank but instead cards with categories/powers. 

Basically not revising and getting into the wishful thinking zone.

So, my lesson learnt over the first day or two was to stop thinking I need to (appear to) be clever by showing off how you can change the brief. New goal, meet the bloody brief!!!!!!!!!!!

The brief was to build on Blackjack we did in sublime/java and visualise it in an android app as we did with the logic from eight ball and word counter.

The whole process was for me to learn from what we covered and get confidence.

So, that’s what I'm doing... Building a game of Twenty-One.
